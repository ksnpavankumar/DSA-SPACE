Simple Idea:

n/2−1: Gives the last parent in the heap.

(n−1)/2: Gives the parent of the last node.


Heap Property vs. Sorted Order:
Heap Property:

In a min-heap, every parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.
This does not guarantee that the array is sorted; it only ensures that the smallest element is at the root (index 0).
Sorted Order:

For the array to be sorted, all elements must follow the order of ascending (or descending) value.
A heap does not maintain this global order; it only ensures local order (parent-child relationships).
