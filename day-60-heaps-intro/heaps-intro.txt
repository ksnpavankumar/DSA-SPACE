Simple Idea:

n/2−1: Gives the last parent in the heap.

(n−1)/2: Gives the parent of the last node.


Heap Property vs. Sorted Order:
Heap Property:

In a min-heap, every parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.
This does not guarantee that the array is sorted; it only ensures that the smallest element is at the root (index 0).
Sorted Order:

For the array to be sorted, all elements must follow the order of ascending (or descending) value.
A heap does not maintain this global order; it only ensures local order (parent-child relationships).

CuttingRopes:

Explanation:
Heap and Tree Analogy:

The Min-Heap is essentially a binary tree where the root node is the smallest.
Each time we merge two ropes, it's like combining two nodes of the binary tree into one, and the tree needs to be restructured (heapified) to maintain the heap property.
Algorithm Flow:

We first build the Min-Heap to ensure the smallest elements are at the root.
We then repeatedly extract the two smallest ropes, calculate their merge cost, and reinsert the combined rope back into the heap.
This process is repeated until only one rope remains, and we return the total merge cost.
Example:

The example shows step-by-step how the ropes are merged, with a binary tree-like structure created during the heapifying and merging steps. It uses the Min-Heap property to always pick the smallest ropes to merge first.
Intuition Block:

The intuition explains the greedy approach behind the algorithm—always merging the smallest ropes first to minimize the total merging cost. This ensures optimality.
