/*
 * Example Execution for generating subsets of [1, 2, 3]:
 *
 * Start with temp = [], index = 0.
 * First, decide whether to include 1 or not.
 *
 * Include 1:
 * temp = [1], index = 1.
 *
 * Now decide whether to include 2 or not.
 * 
 * Include 2:
 * temp = [1, 2], index = 2.
 * Now decide whether to include 3 or not.
 * 
 * Include 3:
 * temp = [1, 2, 3] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 3.
 *
 * Exclude 3:
 * temp = [1, 2] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 2.
 *
 * Exclude 2:
 * temp = [1], index = 2.
 * 
 * Now decide whether to include 3 or not.
 * 
 * Include 3:
 * temp = [1, 3] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 3.
 *
 * Exclude 3:
 * temp = [1] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 1.
 *
 * Exclude 1:
 * temp = [], index = 1.
 * 
 * Now decide whether to include 2 or not.
 * 
 * Include 2:
 * temp = [2], index = 2.
 * 
 * Now decide whether to include 3 or not.
 * 
 * Include 3:
 * temp = [2, 3] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 3.
 *
 * Exclude 3:
 * temp = [2] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 2.
 *
 * Exclude 2:
 * temp = [], index = 2.
 * 
 * Now decide whether to include 3 or not.
 * 
 * Include 3:
 * temp = [3] → Add this subset to the result (res).
 * Backtrack to explore excluding 3.
 *
 * Exclude 3:
 * temp = [] → Add the empty subset to the result (res).
 *
 * Final Subsets Collected:
 * After all the recursive calls and backtracking, the subsets generated are:
 * 
 * [] (empty subset)
 * [1]
 * [2]
 * [3]
 * [1, 2]
 * [1, 3]
 * [2, 3]
 * [1, 2, 3]
 *
 * Summary of the Execution Flow:
 * At each step, the algorithm explores both including and excluding the current element (at index).
 * Backtracking ensures that the algorithm returns to the previous decision point and tries the other option 
 * (e.g., excluding an element after including it).
 * This process continues until all subsets have been generated.
