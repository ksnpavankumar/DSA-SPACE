Inputs with Intuition:
Input 1:
Lists to Merge:

List 1: 1 -> 4 -> 5
List 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4
List 3: 2 -> 6
Intuition:

Start with the smallest heads of the three lists: [1, 1, 2].
Add the smallest 1 to the merged list.
Replace 1 with its next value 4, so the heap becomes [1, 2, 4].
Continue this process, always adding the smallest value to the merged list.
Expected Output:
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Input 2:
Lists to Merge:

Empty input list: []
Intuition:

Since there are no lists, there's nothing to merge.
The result is an empty list.
Expected Output:
Empty list

Input 3:
Lists to Merge:

List 1: 1 -> 4 -> 5
Intuition:

There's only one list. No merging is required.
The merged list is the same as the input list.
Expected Output:
1 -> 4 -> 5

Input 4:
Lists to Merge:

List 1: null
List 2: null
List 3: null
Intuition:

All input lists are null, meaning there's no data to merge.
The result is an empty list.
Expected Output:
Empty list

Input 5:
Lists to Merge:

List 1: 2 -> 3 -> 6
List 2: 1 -> 5 -> 7
List 3: 4 -> 8
Intuition:

Heap starts with [2, 1, 4].
Add 1 to the result, and push 5 (next of 1) to the heap.
Process continues, adding the smallest value, maintaining order.
Expected Output:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
